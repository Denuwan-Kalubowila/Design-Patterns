## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. This repository covers various design patterns and demonstrates how to implement them in TypeScript.

## Creational Patterns

- Singleton

- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

## Structural Patterns

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator

- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **/CreationalPatterns**: Contains examples and implementations of creational design patterns.
- **/StructuralPatterns**: Contains examples and implementations of structural design patterns.
- **/BehavioralPatterns**: Contains examples and implementations of behavioral design patterns.

Each folder includes TypeScript files demonstrating the respective design patterns, along with detailed comments and explan
